## Why are we here?
As mentioned earlier, we are two teams that each and everyone of us has a different set of skills. We wanted to share our knowledge and experience not only with each other but with everyone who is interested.

This Account will be a shared space to collect anything related to Cyber Security (like the ones mentioned before).
These are just the tip of the Iceberg, so don't be shocked when new topics are added. (later in this file, there will be a list of topics)

Do we know it all? most certainly no. So if you know something we don't, We'll be trhilled to hear from you. We welcome new topics, new methods, new tools and anything we don't know or familiar with.
